# Work Justification  
It's any Developers primary responsibility towards the end Application users like yourself, to be facilitated with end results of Data Analytics and Descriptive statistics and doesn't have to get bogged down in the locus of programming difficulties due to the processes like Data Extraction, Loading and Transformations. So, it's my job to abstract you from these mid-level tasks.  
To perform the forth mentioned jobs. I typically work with numerous HDP components to perform various tasks in-regards to Data Extraction, Loading and Transformations.  
  
# Micro KT Justification  
It’s not my responsibility to be forthcoming in building conceptual and very basic understanding in-regards to structuring, coding, extraction, manipulating, adding and parsing of any codes or components associated with Hadoop platforms like HDP or CDH for other Developers or teammates or any other person. U heard me.  
These guys are not students and neither e’m I any sort of professor. This is surely not a University my dear Friend.  
  
# Disappointment Jutification  
I feel not only disappointed and wronged but also feel humiliated and exploited. I also feel that I was being harvested for my skills and knowledge, when it comes to this knowledge sharing session.  
Why shouldn’t I feel so, when things seems so. If it crawls like a snake and sounds like a snake, it is a snake. Buddy.  
  
# Dealing with Teammates  
I will review the notes on these sessions, to see if there are any gaps or empty holes left in the stuff we have covered. Although, I’m sure we went through all the projects and no further sessions will be required. We can do a review tomorrow.
