Remember to Document every thing, do a KT with a plan and get the KT plan approved by the manager first.  Mail the summary of every KT session for each and every session. Make sure about the issue that cann't be tutored and communicate basic iteams are there cross to bear.  
# Work Justification  
It's any Developers primary responsibility towards the end Application users like yourself, to be facilitated with end results of Data Analytics and Descriptive statistics and doesn't have to get bogged down in the locus of programming difficulties due to the processes like Data Extraction, Loading and Transformations. So, it's my job to abstract you from these mid-level tasks.  
To perform the forth mentioned jobs. I typically work with numerous HDP components to perform various tasks in-regards to Data Extraction, Loading and Transformations.  
  
# Micro KT Justification  
It’s not my responsibility to be forthcoming in building conceptual and very basic understanding in-regards to structuring, coding, extraction, manipulating, adding and parsing of any codes or components associated with Hadoop platforms like HDP or CDH for other Developers or teammates or any other person. U heard me.  
These guys are not students and neither e’m I any sort of professor. This is surely not a University my dear Friend.  
  
# Disappointment Jutification  
I feel not only disappointed and wronged but also feel humiliated and exploited. I also feel that I was being harvested for my skills and knowledge, when it comes to this knowledge sharing session.  
Why shouldn’t I feel so, when things seems so. If it crawls like a snake and sounds like a snake, it is a snake. Buddy.  
  
# Dealing with Teammates  
I will review the notes on these sessions, to see if there are any gaps or empty holes left in the stuff we have covered. Although, I’m sure we went through all the projects and no further sessions will be required. We can do a review tomorrow.  
  
# Dealing with shitty issues  
The main issue seems to be some-one is using the cluster from backend which is not suggestable and was made clear earlier, 
this cluster is not designed for the bidirectional loads.  
i) The job will fail today also because of the query structure given by the arcadia user, show below. It is running for more than 8 hours. I can’t take the responsibility to cancel those because I don’t know if this was planned for testing purpose by other developers or left running unintentionally.  
ii) These residue queries need to be killed by the arcadia user. Or else it will cause the jobs to be backlogged as show below.  
iii) These backlogs will cause long queues of jobs, before the cluster overhead reaches its limits and fails.  
iv)	I’m in office till 6:30 Pm yesterday working on identifying issues with mfg_reports because currently I’m the only person responsible for Development, testing, Support and Administration.  
v)	The user who gave the query need to be responsible. I can only be alerted and work to start debugging, once I was informed and was aware of the issue. No one informed of the bug yesterday and the I didn’t notice the alerts. The cluster resources were available only to Developers and it was also a developer who has broken the cluster yesterday and was trying to break it today as well.  
vi)	I have made necessary modifications for job to go through today, but it was team responsibility(specially the individual, who is running the query) to make sure of resources for queries were available and to alert the necessary member(if he/she is unaware) to fix it.  
vii) Please be aware of the above points, use cluster with perspicacity and make necessary teammate/ teammates aware of the problems on a needy basis, I thank you for fulling your responsibility yesterday.  
  
### All this because "If you're giving your all to someone and it's not enough, you're giving it to the wrong person."
