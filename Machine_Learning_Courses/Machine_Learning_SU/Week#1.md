## Machine Learning:  
Machine learning is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building. Using algorithms that iteratively learn from data, machine learning allows computers to find hidden insights without being explicitly programmed where to look. 
  
## Variable Notion:  
In machine learning, a target is called a label.  
In statistics, a target is called a dependent variable.  
A variable in statistics is called a feature in machine learning.  
A transformation in statistics is called feature creation in machine learning.   
  
## Supervised Learning:  
Supervised learning is a type of machine learning algorithm that uses a known dataset (called the training dataset) to make predictions. The training dataset includes input data and response values. From it, the supervised learning algorithm seeks to build a model that can make predictions of the response values for a new dataset. A test dataset is often used to validate the model. Using larger training datasets often yield models with higher predictive power that can generalize well for new datasets.  
  
Supervised learning includes two categories of algorithms:  
Classification: for categorical response values, where the data can be separated into specific “classes”  
Regression: for continuous-response values  
    
## UnSupervised Learning:  
Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning algorithm used to draw inferences from datasets consisting of input data without labeled responses.  
The most common unsupervised learning method is cluster analysis, which is used for exploratory data analysis to find hidden patterns or grouping in data. The clusters are modeled using a measure of similarity which is defined upon metrics such as Euclidean or probabilistic distance.  
With unsupervised learning there is no feedback based on the prediction results.
